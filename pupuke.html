    <!-- Descriptive section about Lake Pupuke -->
    <div id="desc">
        <h1>About Lake Pupuke</h1>
        <p>Traditionally known in Māori as <span>Pupukemoana</span> is a heart-shaped freshwater lake occupying a <span>volcanic crater</span> (or maar) situated to the east of Westlake Boys High School. The <span>heart shape</span> is a result of its formation by the linking of <span>two circular craters</span> - a larger one forming most of the lake and a smaller one forming the arm in the northeast. </p>
        <p>Separated from the sea by less than 200 m at one point, it has a circumference of about 4.5 km and reaches 57m in depth. It is popular for <span>recreational activities</span> and the lake front property around it. </p>
        <h1>Geology</h1>
        <p><span>Other similar craters</span> in the Auckland volcanic field were either <span>buried</span> by <span>later eruptions</span> or <span>breached</span> by <span>erosion</span> as rainwater collected and overflowed the edge of the crater. </p>
        <p>Lake Pupuke remains a <span>lake</span> because, unlike the other vents, its eruptions produced <span>substantial lava flows</span>; <span>water</span> can thus <span>escape through cracks</span> in the lava reaching under the crater wall, creating a series of <span>freshwater springs</span> along the beaches between Takapuna and Milford. </p>
        <p>The lava flow at the end of <span>Takapuna Beach</span> enveloped a <span>kauri forest</span>, producing an internationally significant collection of <span>tree moulds</span>, which has been called <span>"New Zealand's only example of a fossil forest preserved in a lava flow"</span> and which <span>"ranks among the best examples in the world."</span> </p>
        <p>Some moulds have escaped burial by the boat ramp and car park built on top of the lava and can be viewed at low tide. </p>
        <h1>Māori legend</h1>
        <p>A traditional Māori legend surrounding the lake tells of a <span>tupua couple</span>, <span>children</span> of the <span>fire gods</span>. After quarreling and <span>cursing Mahuika</span>, the <span>fire-goddess</span>, their <span>home</span> on the mainland was <span>destroyed</span> by <span>Matahoe</span>, <span>god of earthquakes and eruptions</span>, on Mahuika's behalf.</p>
        <p><span>Lake Pupuke resulted</span> from the <span>destruction</span>, while <span>Rangitoto Island</span> rose from the sea as their <span>exile</span>. The mists surrounding Rangitoto at certain times are considered the <span>tears of the tupua couple</span> for their former home. </p>
        <h1>Human Use</h1>
        <p>Close to the Takapuna city centre, the lake is popular not only with <span>wild birds</span> (such as shags) but with <span>picnickers, paddlers, kayakers, rowers, yachtsmen, divers, and windsurfers</span> (lessons have been given on the lake). <span>Free divers</span> (no tanks) have <span>practiced</span> in the lake. <span>College rowing crews</span> use it. There have been <span>boating races</span>. and the <span>Pupuke Boating Club</span> operates there. <span>Takapuna Boating Club</span> hosts <span>regattas</span>. </p>
        <p>The <span>Auckland Dragon Boat Association</span> runs an annual <span>regionals race</span> event on the lake, with 200m, 500m and 2 km races. The lake is the venue for <span>Dragon Boat, Canoe sprints, Canoe marathon, and Waka Ama sprint racing</span> within the <span>Canoe Competition</span> at the <span>World Masters Games 2017</span> held in Auckland. </p>
        <p>Lake Pupuke is suitable for <span>swimming</span> but is <span>murky</span> and contains thick <span>vegetation</span>, and there have been <span>drownings</span>. The lake has been tested for bacteria and generally meets <span>safe swimming conditions</span>. </p>

    <!-- Descriptive section about Ngāti Pāoa -->
    <div id="desc">
        <h1>Ngāti Pāoa</h1>
        <p><span>Ngāti Pāoa</span> is a <span>Māori iwi</span> of the <span>Hauraki region</span>. Its <span>traditional lands</span> stretch from the western side of the <span>Hauraki Plains to Auckland</span>. They also settled on Hauraki Gulf islands such as Waiheke.</p>
        <p>Ngāti Pāoa is one of <span>five tribes</span> of the <span>Marutūāhu confederation</span>, the others being Ngāti Maru, Ngāti Rongoū, Ngāti Tamaterā and Ngāti Whanaunga.</p>
        <p>The <span>Marutūāhu tribes</span> are all descended from <span>Marutūāhu</span>, a <span>son of Hotunui</span>, who is said to have arrived in New Zealand on the <span>Tainui canoe</span>. The Marutūāhu tribes are therefore part of the <span>Tainui group of tribes</span>. The Marutūāhu confederation is also part of the <span>Hauraki collective of tribes</span>.</p>
        <h1>Early history</h1>
        <p>Ngāti Pāoa is <span>descended</span> from <span>Pāoa</span>. According to a <span>Hauraki tradition</span> his <span>father</span> was <span>Rongo-tiu-moe-whara</span> of the East Coast iwi, <span>Ngāti Kahungunu</span>, born at <span>Whai-a-pāoa</span> near Wharekahika.</p>
        <p>According to <span>Tainui accounts</span> his <span>father</span> was <span>Hekemaru</span>, his <span>paternal grandparents</span> were <span>Pikia</span>o from the <span>Te Arawa tribe</span>, and <span>Rereiao</span>, a <span>high-born Waikato woman</span> descended from <span>Whatihua</span>, and he was the <span>brother</span> of <span>Mahuta</span>, from whom <span>Ngāti Mahuta</span> is descended.</p>
        <p>On either version, <span>Pāoa</span> lived with his first wife <span>Tauhākari, sons Toapoto and Toawhana, and daughter Koura</span> at <span>Kaitotehe</span>, near Taupiri in the central Waikato.</p>
        <p>Pāoa moved from <span>Kaitotehe to Hauraki</span>, where he <span>married Tukutuku</span>, a <span>granddaughter of Tamaterā</span>, with whom he had <span>sons</span>, <span>first Haora Tipa Koinaki and second Horowhenua</span>.</p>
        <p>Pāoa and Tukutuku's children lived in and around the <span>Hauraki Plains</span>. Ngāti Pāoa later spread to the <span>western side</span> of the <span>Firth of Thames</span>, from where they also frequented the Hunua Ranges.</p>
        <p>By the 1700s they also frequented the <span>Tāmaki (Auckland) isthmus</span>, the <span>North Shore</span> and the <span>eastern and northern Coromandel Peninsula</span>.</p>
        <p>In about 1780, Ngāti Pāoa established settlements along the western side of the <span>Tamaki River</span> and at <span>Mokoia</span> (present-day <span>Panmure</span>).</p>
        <p>In 1790 and from 1793 to 1798 they engaged in many <span>battles</span> with <span>tribes</span> to the <span>north</span>, at least as far as the <span>Mahurangi district</span>.</p>
        <p>By 1805 they were tiring of war and negotiated <span>peace settlements</span> with many <span>neighbouring tribes</span>. At this time they had <span>settlements</span> along the <span>Tamaki River</span> as far as <span>Otahuhu</span>.</p>
