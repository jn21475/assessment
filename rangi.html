        <h2>About Rangitoto</h2>
        <p>Rangitoto Island is a <span>volcanic island</span> in the Hauraki Gulf.</p>
        <p>The <span>5.5  km (3.4  mi)</span> wide island is a symmetrical  shield volcano  cone, reaching a <span>height of 260  m (850  ft)</span>. Rangitoto is the <span>youngest and largest</span> of the approximately 50 volcanoes of the  Auckland volcanic field, having formed in an eruption about <span>600 years ago</span>, and covering an area of <span>2,311  ha (5,710 acres)</span>.</p>
        <p> It is separated from the mainland of Auckland's  North Shore  by the  <span>Rangitoto Channel</span>. </p>
        <p>Since  World War II, it has been linked by a causeway to the much older, non-volcanic  Motutapu Island.</p>
        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>Rangitoto  is  Māori  for <span>'Bloody Sky'</span>,  with the name coming from the full phrase  <span>Ngā Rangi-i-totongia-a Tama-te-kapua</span>  ("The days of the bleeding of Tama-te-kapua").  </p>
        <p><span>Tama-te-kapua</span>  was the captain of the  Arawa  waka  (canoe) and was badly <span>wounded</span> on the island, after having <span>lost a battle</span> with the  Tainui  iwi  (tribe) at Islington Bay.</p>
        <h2>Māori association</h2>
        <p>The volcano erupted <span>within the historical memory of the local  Māori  iwi</span>  (tribes). </p>
        <p><span>Human footprints</span> have been found between layers of Rangitoto volcanic ash on the adjoining  Motutapu Island.  </p>
        <p><span>Ngāi Tai</span>  was the iwi living on Motutapu, and considers both islands their <span>ancestral home</span>.  <span>Ngāti Paoa</span>  also has links with Rangitoto.</p>
        <h2>Geology</h2>
        <p>Rangitoto was formed during a <span>single phase of eruptions</span> that may have lasted only <span>5-10 years</span>, about <span>600 years ago</span>. </p>
        <p><span>Previous inferences</span> that it was formed by a <span>series of eruptions</span> commencing at least <span>6000 years ago</span> have been <span>disproved</span> by the most recent research. </p>
        <p>The first part of the eruption was <span>wet</span> and produced surges of <span>volcanic ash</span> that <span>mantles neighbouring Motutapu Island</span>. </p>
        <p>The later part of the eruption was <span>dry</span> and <span>built most of Rangitoto</span>, erupting all the lava flows and  scoria cones  at the apex.  </p>
        <p>The 2.3  km^3  (0.55  cu  mi) of material that erupted from the volcano was about equal to the combined mass produced by all the previous eruptions in the Auckland volcanic field, which were spread over more than 200,000 years.</p>
        <p>In 2013, scientists from Auckland University said new studies showed <span>Rangitoto had been much more active</span> in the past than previously thought, suggesting it had been active on and off for around 1000 years before the final eruptions around 550 years ago (BP= before 1950).  </p>
        <p>In February 2014 a 150  m (490  ft) deep hole was drilled through the western flank of Rangitoto. The same group of university scientists declared that it revealed a long history of <span>spasmodic eruptions</span> going back at least 6000 years, although the bulk of activity post-dated 650 years. </p>
        <p>Civil Defence officials said the discovery <span>did not make living in Auckland any more dangerous</span>, but did <span>change their view of how an eruption might proceed</span>.  These headline-grabbing results have been <span>controversial</span> and <span>not accepted by all geologists</span>. </p>
        <p>In 2018, most of the original group of Auckland University geologists reported on their latest research and reinterpretation of the drillhole sequence  and pronounced that the <span>island did not erupt off and on prior to its major eruption about 600 years ago</span> and is <span>not a unique  polygenetic volcano  in the monogenetic Auckland volcanic field</span>, as they had previously inferred. </p>
        <p>While it is possible that Rangitoto <span>buried one or more smaller volcanoes</span>, to date there is <span>no strong evidence</span> to support this idea.</p>
        <p>Subsidence back down the throat during the cooling process has left a moat-like ring around the crater summit, which may be viewed from a path which goes right round the rim and up to the highest point.</p>
        <p> In some parts of the island, fields of  <span>clinker-like black lava stones</span> are exposed, appearing very recent to a casual eye. About 200 metres from the top of the mountain on the eastern side visitors can walk through some of about seven known  <span>lava tubes</span>  — tubes left behind after the passage of liquid lava. The more accessible of the caves are signposted.  </p>
        <p>At Rangitoto the large tubes are <span>cave-like</span>. A torch is needed to explore the caves. The <span>longest known cave is about 50 m long</span>.</p>

        <h2>About Waitemata Harbour</h2>
        <p>Waitematā Harbour is the <span>main access by sea to Auckland</span>. For this reason it is often referred to as <span>Auckland Harbour</span>, despite the fact that it is one of two harbours adjoining the city.</p>
        <p>The harbour <span>forms the northern and eastern coasts of the Auckland isthmus</span> and is crossed by the Auckland Harbour Bridge. It is matched on the southern side of the city by the shallower waters of the Manukau Harbour.</p>
        <p>With an area of 70 square miles (180 km2), it <span>connects the city's main port</span> and the <span>Auckland waterfront to the Hauraki Gulf</span> and the <span>Pacific Ocean</span>. It is sheltered from Pacific storms by Auckland's North Shore, Rangitoto Island, and Waiheke Island.</p>
        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The oldest Māori name of the harbour was <span>Te Whanga-nui o Toi (The Big Bay of Toi)</span>, named after Toi, an early Māori explorer.</p>
        <p>The name Waitematā means <span>"Te Mata Waters"</span>, which according to some traditions refers to a <span>mauri stone</span> (a stone of Māori religious significance) called <span>Te Mata</span>, which was placed on <span>Boat Rock</span> (in the harbour south-west of Chatswood) by Te Arawa chief Kahumatamomoe. </p>
        <p>A popular translation of Waitematā is <span>"The Obsidian Waters"</span>, referring to obsidian rock (matā). </p>
        <p>Another popular translation, derived from this, is <span>"The Sparkling Waters"</span>, as the harbour waters were said to glint like the volcanic glass obsidian. However, this is incorrect, as grammatically Waitematā could not mean this.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Prior to European settlement, the harbour was the site of many <span>Tāmaki Māori pā and kāinga</span>, including Kauri Point in Chatswood, Okā at Point Erin, Te Tō at Freemans Bay, Te Ngahuwera, Te Rerenga-oraiti at Point Britomart, and Ōrākei. </p>
        <p>Herald Island and Watchmen Island were both settled by the <span>Waiohua confederation</span>. </p>
        <p>The Waitematā Harbour was traditionally used as a <span>fishery</span> used by Tāmaki Māori for <span>sharks and snapper</span>. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the waters were fished together by Ngāti Whātua-o-Ōrākei and Ngāti Pāoa. </p>
        <p>In traditional legend, the Waitematā Harbour is <span>protected</span> by a <span>taniwha named Ureia</span>, who takes the form of a whale.</p>
        <p>The harbour has long been the <span>main anchorage</span> and <span>port area</span> for the Auckland region. <span>Well-sheltered</span> not only by the Hauraki Gulf itself but also by Rangitoto Island, the harbour offered <span>good protection</span> in almost all <span>winds</span>, and <span>lacked dangerous shoals</span> or <span>major sand bars</span> (like on the Manukau Harbour) that would have made entry difficult. </p>
        <p>The harbour also proved a <span>fertile area</span> for <span>encroaching development</span>, with major land reclamation undertaken, especially along the Auckland waterfront, within a few decades of the city's European founding.</p>
        <p>Taking the idea of the several Māori portage paths over the isthmus one step further, the creation of a <span>canal</span> that would link the Waitematā and Manukau harbours was <span>considered</span> in the early 1900s. </p>
        <p>Legislation (the Auckland and Manukau Canal Act 1908) was passed that would allow <span>authorities to take privately owned land where it was deemed required for a canal</span>. However, <span>no serious work</span> (or land take) was undertaken. The act was repealed on 1 November 2010.</p>
